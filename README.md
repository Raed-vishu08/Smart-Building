# Smart-Building
IOT project made by using with the help of esp8266 and all the data stored in thingspeak



This an IOT project making a smart building with home
automation using PIR sensors and ThingSpeak .With the help of thingspeak I
presented the number of persons entered and left the room and through LDR
sensor presented the amount of light in room so that if there is sufficient
amount of light bulb will not glow this information is extracted by ESP8266. This
project has given me confidence to work further on Fire sensors, ultrasonic sensor , smoke sensor, ESP32,etc.
